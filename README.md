# GameTemplate
This game template is made with and for Godot v4.5 Mono with GDscript starter code. It is safe to use with base Godot v4.5.

## Starter Code
The starter code handles the following with basic implementation, allowing the creator to do as they please.
- Subpixel camera movement
- Global SubViewportContainer Tracking
- Basic Player Movement (Walk and Jump)

## Purpose
The purpose of this game template is to allow new devs that are new to Godot to get a good grip with what works, how they can organize a project, and focus more on level design or implementing their own core system and mechanics as they please.

### What Level Design Is
- Functionality
- Gameplay
- Short Iteration Cycles
- Creative, Messy Experimentation
- Strategic, Structured Approaches

### What Level Design Is Not
- Environmental Art
- Worldbuilding

## Level Design Guidelines
These are not rules these are suggestions that as a level designer, should try to keep in mind when designing your level.
- Guide the player
- Challenge the player
- Design with purpose. How does the level progress the game?
- Does the level communicate all it needs to with the player

## Pretty/Beautiful Corners
When making a level, it can be hard to continuously look at greyboxed, basic, relatively plain textures. 

So make a _**small**_ beautiful corner of your level that is what you expect and want your game to look like at the end. This makes it easier at the end to go through, updating art and making sure that it is both uniform and efficient.
